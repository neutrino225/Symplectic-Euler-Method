# Symplectic-Euler-Method
Symplectic Euler Method uses the final position which an object reaches to in the given time step and then uses that position to calculate the velocity.



In this script we calculated the velocity and the distance of a pendulum over 50 equal steps using the Symlectic Euler's Method
